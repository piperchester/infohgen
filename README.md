infohgen
========

Simple shell script to generate markup from a user's system info.

### Usage
The script will echo markup that the dev can redirect into web-worthy data:   
`./infohgen > page.html; open page.html`

### Recognition
The real credit for this project goes to William E. Shots Jr. The boilerplate and inspiration for this script originate from him.
